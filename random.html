<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<!-- <h3>Spice Mix:</h3> -->
<ul>
    <li>1 English cucumber, peeled
    </li>
    <li>2 fluid ounces fresh lime juice 
    </li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
    </li>
    <li>2 cups ice
    </li>
    <li>8 fluid ounces tonic water
    </li>
    <li>2 slices lime, for serving
    </li>
    <!-- <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder
    </li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
    </li> -->
</ul>
<!-- <h3>Corn ribs:</h3> -->
<!-- <ul>
    <li>4 ears fresh corn, shucked
    </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil
    </li>
    <li>4 tablespoons melted butter
    </li>
</ul> -->

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cut two thin slices from cucumber and set aside for garnish. Chop remaining cucumber into large chunks and place in blender with lime juice and sugar. Blend until smooth. Strain the cucumber mixture through a fine strainer into a jar. You should have about 8 ounces. </li>
    <li>Fill two glasses with ice. Divide the mixture between the glasses, about 4 ounces each. Top each glass with 4 ounces of tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber and lime slice and serve. </li>
    <!-- <li>In a small bowl, whisk olive oil, steak seasoning, salt, and pepper until evenly combined. Brush mixture over the cabbage wedges. </li>
    <li>Place baking sheet on the grate of the preheated smoker and smoke for 1 1/2 hours. Transfer to a serving dish and top with bacon pieces. Serve immediately. </li> -->
    <!-- <li> To finish indoors, preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler and set a rack 7 to 8 inches from the heating element. Line a baking pan with foil.  </li>
    <li>Arrange corn ribs on the prepared pan with the maximum number of kernels facing up, toward the heat. Extra foil can be placed on the pan to prop up ribs into the right position. Once arranged, sprinkle with more spice mixture if so desired. </li>
    <li>Broil on High until corn starts to brown in spots, about 7 minutes. Remove and rearrange ribs as needed, so that areas of kernels that are not yet browned are facing up toward the heat, and continue to broil until corn is golden-brown with some charred spots, 7 to 8 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Remove and brush with melted butter; season to taste with remaining spice mixture</li> -->
